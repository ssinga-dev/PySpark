# PySpark

PySpark is the Python library for Spark programming. It provides a simple programming interface to the Apache Spark framework, allowing developers to easily process and analyze large amounts of data using a familiar API. PySpark is designed to work with the Py4J library, which enables Python programs to interact with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on which Spark runs. PySpark enables developers to create distributed data processing applications using Python, and it supports a wide range of data sources, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache Cassandra, and Apache HBase.
